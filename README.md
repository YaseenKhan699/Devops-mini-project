# Devops-mini-project-Day-2
# 🚀 To-Do App (Dockerized)

## Project Overview
This is a simple To-Do web app containerized with Docker.  
The image is hosted on **Docker Hub**:  
👉 [yaseenkhan699/todo-app](https://hub.docker.com/r/yaseenkhan699/todo-app)

---

## Steps I Practiced
1. Built Docker image locally  
2. Tagged and pushed it to Docker Hub  
3. Pulled the image back from Docker Hub  
4. Ran the app locally → accessible on `http://localhost:3000`

## Run the App Yourself
```bash
docker pull yaseenkhan699/todo-app:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 yaseenkhan699/todo-app:latest

Day 3 – Multi-Container Setup with Docker Compose (Todo-App + MySQL)

On Day 3, I extended my todo-app by replacing the SQLite database with MySQL and running both services together using Docker Compose.

🔹 Steps I Followed

1. Created a docker-compose.yml file:

version: '3.8'

services:
  todo-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=root
      - DB_PASSWORD=example
      - DB_NAME=tododb
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: tododb
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:


2. Started both containers:

docker-compose up -d


3. Verified connectivity by entering the MySQL container:

docker exec -it project-db-1 mysql -u root -p


4. Checked tables and inserted data:

SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM todo_items;


Screenshot – MySQL Query Output

5. Tested persistence:
Tasks stayed even after restarting containers (thanks to volumes).

Devops-mini-project-Day-4
🚀 To-Do App (CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Docker)
Project Overview

This project extends the To-Do app with CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
The pipeline builds the Docker image, runs integration tests with MySQL, and pushes the image to Docker Hub:
👉 yaseenkhan699/todo-app

Steps I Practiced

Created .github/workflows/docker-ci.yml for CI/CD

Added GitHub Secrets: DOCKER_USERNAME & DOCKER_PASSWORD

Built and pushed Docker image automatically on every push to master

Ran integration tests inside CI:

Started MySQL container

Connected app container to MySQL using Docker network

Verified app container started and logs showed successful DB connection

Fixed issues:

Initial workflow failed due to missing secrets → added both secrets correctly

App container couldn’t connect via localhost → used Docker network for CI containers

Verified workflow success → image built, tested, and pushed to Docker Hub

Confirmed local container runs correctly on port 3000

DevOps-mini-project-Day-5
🚀 To-Do App (Deployed on AWS EC2)
Project Overview

This is a simple To-Do web app containerized with Docker and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.
The app is accessible externally:
👉 http://3.232.56.132:3000

Steps I Practiced

Launched EC2 Instance

Ubuntu 22.04, t2.micro (Free tier)

Allowed inbound ports: 22 (SSH), 3000 (App), 3306 (MySQL)

SSH into EC2

ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@3.232.56.132


Installed Docker & Docker Compose

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker --version
docker-compose --version


Cloned Project Repo

git clone https://github.com/YaseenKhan699/Devops-mini-project.git
cd Devops-mini-project


Ran Docker Containers on EC2

sudo docker-compose up -d
sudo docker ps


Ensured ports are mapped: 0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp

Verified App is Running

Checked container logs and server binding (0.0.0.0)

Accessed app via browser: http://3.232.56.132:3000

Run the App Yourself on EC2
git clone https://github.com/YaseenKhan699/Devops-mini-project.git
cd Devops-mini-project
sudo docker-compose up -d


Then open your EC2 public IP + port 3000 in a browser:

http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000
