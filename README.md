# Devops-mini-project-Day-2
# ðŸš€ To-Do App (Dockerized)

## Project Overview
This is a simple To-Do web app containerized with Docker.  
The image is hosted on **Docker Hub**:  
ðŸ‘‰ [yaseenkhan699/todo-app](https://hub.docker.com/r/yaseenkhan699/todo-app)

---

## Steps I Practiced
1. Built Docker image locally  
2. Tagged and pushed it to Docker Hub  
3. Pulled the image back from Docker Hub  
4. Ran the app locally â†’ accessible on `http://localhost:3000`

Day 3 â€“ Multi-Container Setup with Docker Compose (Todo-App + MySQL)

On Day 3, I extended my todo-app by replacing the SQLite database with MySQL and running both services together using Docker Compose.

ðŸ”¹ Steps I Followed

1. Created a docker-compose.yml file:

version: '3.8'

services:
  todo-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=root
      - DB_PASSWORD=example
      - DB_NAME=tododb
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: tododb
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:


2. Started both containers:

docker-compose up -d


3. Verified connectivity by entering the MySQL container:

docker exec -it project-db-1 mysql -u root -p


4. Checked tables and inserted data:

SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM todo_items;


Screenshot â€“ MySQL Query Output

5. Tested persistence:
Tasks stayed even after restarting containers (thanks to volumes).

Devops-mini-project-Day-4
ðŸš€ To-Do App (CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Docker)
Project Overview

This project extends the To-Do app with CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
The pipeline builds the Docker image, runs integration tests with MySQL, and pushes the image to Docker Hub:
ðŸ‘‰ yaseenkhan699/todo-app

Steps I Practiced

Created .github/workflows/docker-ci.yml for CI/CD

Added GitHub Secrets: DOCKER_USERNAME & DOCKER_PASSWORD

Built and pushed Docker image automatically on every push to master

Ran integration tests inside CI:

Started MySQL container

Connected app container to MySQL using Docker network

Verified app container started and logs showed successful DB connection

Fixed issues:

Initial workflow failed due to missing secrets â†’ added both secrets correctly

App container couldnâ€™t connect via localhost â†’ used Docker network for CI containers

Verified workflow success â†’ image built, tested, and pushed to Docker Hub

Confirmed local container runs correctly on port 3000
